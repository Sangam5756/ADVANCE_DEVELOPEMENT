# next

## server side rendering

- hit url get all thing in one index.html file
- all the processing done on the server

the thing i learned today the next js we write the component as async

- Async component

- loading.tsx
  - if the component is gonna take time to fetch the data
  - in mean time what should user see
  - obviously the loader
  - so next js say put the loading.tsx in the top of file
  - next will automatically identifies it and show the user loading while data is not present
