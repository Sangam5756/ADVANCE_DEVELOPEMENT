### COOKIES

- Persistent Cookies: Stay on the user's device until expiry or deletion.
- Session Cookies: Last only for the duration of the browser session.
- Secure Cookies: Only sent over HTTPS to ensure secure transmission.

#### PROPERTIES OF COOKIES

## 1. HttpOnly

- **Purpose**: Prevents client-side JavaScript from accessing the cookie, reducing the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **Example**:  
  If a cookie is set with `HttpOnly`, JavaScript cannot read the value of that cookie, even if there is a malicious script on the page.
  ```http
  Set-Cookie: sessionId=abc123; HttpOnly
  ```
  In this case, only the server can access the `sessionId`, not JavaScript running in the browser.

## 2. SameSite

- **Purpose**: Controls whether the cookie is sent with cross-site requests, helping prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.

  - CSRF occurs when a malicious website tricks the user into making an unwanted request to another website where the user is already authenticated, potentially performing actions like changing passwords or making payments.
  - SameSite helps prevent this by ensuring that cookies are only sent with requests originating from the same site, not from a third-party website.
  - If you're logged into example.com, and you visit malicious.com, the malicious site won't be able to send requests to example.com with your authentication cookies if SameSite=Strict or SameSite=Lax is set on those cookies.

### Options for SameSite:

- **Strict**:

  - **Purpose**: The cookie is only sent in requests originating from the same domain, preventing the cookie from being sent with cross-site requests.
  - **Example**:  
    If you visit a site `example.com`, and it sets a cookie with `SameSite=Strict`, the cookie will **not** be sent if you make a request to `example.com` from another website.
    ```http
    Set-Cookie: userToken=xyz789; SameSite=Strict
    ```
  - **Use case**: Ideal for sensitive information like login tokens where you want to ensure that the cookie is only sent on the same site.

- **Lax**:

  - **Purpose**: The cookie is sent with top-level navigation requests (e.g., when you type in the URL in the browser) but not with embedded content like images or iframes from other sites.
  - **Example**:  
    If you visit `example.com` and click a link to another website that redirects back to `example.com`, the cookie will be sent.
    ```http
    Set-Cookie: userToken=xyz789; SameSite=Lax
    ```
  - **Use case**: A good balance between security and usability, for cases like login sessions, where you donâ€™t want cross-site requests to be sent but want cookies available for redirects.

- **None**:
  - **Purpose**: The cookie is sent with all cross-site requests, regardless of the origin. This option requires the cookie to also have the `Secure` flag (only sent over HTTPS).
  - **Example**:  
    If your website `example.com` has a third-party service embedded in an iframe, and it needs to access the cookie, `SameSite=None` would allow that.
    ```http
    Set-Cookie: userToken=xyz789; SameSite=None; Secure
    ```
  - **Use case**: Useful for third-party integrations or APIs where the cookie must be available across different sites or domains.

## 3. Secure

- **Purpose**: Ensures that the cookie is only sent over secure HTTPS connections, preventing the cookie from being transmitted over unsecured HTTP.
- **Example**:  
  When a user is logged in on `example.com`, the cookie storing their session ID will only be sent if the connection is over HTTPS.
  ```http
  Set-Cookie: sessionId=abc123; Secure
  ```
  - **Use case**: Always used for sensitive cookies (like login sessions or payment data) to prevent cookies from being intercepted over insecure HTTP connections.

## 4. Domain

- **Purpose**: Specifies the domain for which the cookie is valid. By default, cookies are only sent to the domain that set them, but using the `Domain` attribute, the cookie can be shared across subdomains.
- **Example**:  
  If you want a cookie to be accessible to `sub.example.com` and `another.example.com`, you can set the domain attribute to `.example.com`.

  ```http
  Set-Cookie: userToken=xyz789; Domain=.example.com
  ```

  In this case, the `userToken` cookie will be sent to all subdomains of `example.com`, like `sub.example.com`, but not to domains outside of `example.com`.

- **Use case**: Used when you need to share cookies across multiple subdomains (e.g., `shop.example.com` and `blog.example.com`), but not across different domains (e.g., `example.com` and `anotherdomain.com`).
