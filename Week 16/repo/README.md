# Monorepo (Monolithic Repository)

A **monorepo** is a single code repository that contains multiple projects, often related, such as front-end, back-end, and shared libraries. Instead of having separate repositories for each project, everything is in one place.

## Benefits:
- **Centralized code**: All projects are in one repository.
- **Atomic changes**: You can update multiple projects in one go.
- **Easy collaboration**: Teams can work together more easily.

## Challenges:
- **Scalability**: Large repositories can get slow and complex.
- **Tooling**: Requires special tools to handle large codebases.

# Turborepo

**Turborepo** is a tool that helps improve the performance of monorepos. It speeds up building and testing by caching results, only rebuilding what's changed, and running tasks in parallel.

## Benefits:
- **Faster builds**: Only rebuilds what's necessary.
- **Parallel tasks**: Runs tasks at the same time, saving time.
- **Caching**: Saves time by reusing previous builds.

Turborepo makes it easier to manage and work with large monorepos by optimizing build and development processes.
