Vertical scaling - we increase the machine size
Horizontal scaling - we increate server

# Vertical Scaling:

- Increasing the power of a single server (e.g., upgrading the CPU, adding more RAM, or using faster storage). This improves the performance of the server handling the workload but has hardware limitations.

## Vertical Scaling: Bigger Coffee Machine

#**EXAMPLE**# <br>
Imagine you own a small café that serves coffee.

1. At first, you have one small coffee machine. It works fine when there are only a few customers.
2. As your business grows, the machine can’t keep up with the increasing demand.
3. To solve this, you replace your small coffee machine with a bigger, faster machine that can make more coffee at once.
   This is vertical scaling—you upgraded your existing system (the coffee machine) to handle more load. But, there's a limit: even the biggest coffee machine can only make so much coffee.

# Horizontal Scaling:

- Adding more servers to the system (e.g., creating a cluster of servers) to share the workload. This approach is more scalable and fault-tolerant, as multiple servers handle traffic together.

## Horizontal Scaling: Adding More Coffee Machines

#**EXAMPLE**# <br>
Now imagine your café becomes super popular, and even the biggest coffee machine isn’t enough to meet demand.

1. Instead of relying on one machine, you buy multiple coffee machines and hire more staff.
2. Now, each machine can serve a portion of the customers, and together, they handle the rush more efficiently.

   This is horizontal scaling—you distribute the load across multiple systems (coffee machines). If demand keeps increasing, you can just add more machines.
